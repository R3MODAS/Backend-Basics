Restful API

It is a representational state/standard way of defining API by using appropiate and proper methods `GET,POST,PUT,PATCH,DELETE` and also sending correct status codes.

MVC Model
----------
It is known as Model View Controller. `Model` means the data and the type of data we will be dealing with, `View` means showing the data in the UI, `Controllers` are function/methods that helps to write logics to show the data in UI properly 

NoSQL DB Structure
-------------------
There is a `DB Server` and inside that there is `Database` and inside it there is `Collections` and it contains one/more `Document/Documents`. The data inside the `Document` is in BSON format and the `objectId` inside the `Document` works like the concept of `Primary Key`.

DB Server -> Databases -> Collections -> Documents for NoSQL DB
DB Server -> Databases -> Tables -> Tuples for SQL DB
